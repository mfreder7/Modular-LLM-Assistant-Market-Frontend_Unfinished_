# Modular LLM Assistant Marketplace (Unfinished Project)

This repository contains an **unfinished project** that was intended to serve as a marketplace for modular LLM-powered assistants. While I no longer plan to complete this project, I’ve decided to make it publicly available for contributions or for anyone looking for an example of **handling streaming responses from LLMs (GPT-powered assistant)** over WebSockets.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Built with **React**, **Ionic**, and **Capacitor**.
- **TypeScript** for clean, maintainable code.
- Powered by **Vite** for a fast and modern development experience.
- **WebSocket Integration**: Demonstrates how to handle streaming responses from LLMs in real time.
- **Working Base WebSocket Chat**: Fully functional and connects to my public backend repository: [assistant_server](https://github.com/mfreder7/assistant_server).
